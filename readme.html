## 🚗 Project Overview
The goal was to create a modern, user-friendly website that would:
- Display available vehicles  
- Allow customers to select rental dates  
- Process online payments securely  
- Manage reservations efficiently  
- Integrate with JMCars’ existing desktop application and database

## 🛠️ Technical Approach
- **WordPress** was chosen for its flexibility and powerful content management features.  
- A **custom plugin** was developed to handle the booking workflow, including reservation management and **Stripe** payment integration.  
- A **custom theme** was designed to align with JMCars’ branding, with a strong emphasis on **mobile responsiveness** and **user experience**.

- This ensured real-time data synchronization while maintaining strong security practices.
